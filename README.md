# StudioCore V6.3 — Adaptive Multilayer Analysis Engine

StudioCore V6.3 is a dynamic, multi-layer AI engine capable of interpreting lyrics, tone, rhythm, emotional structures, breathing, vocal parameters and generating adaptive prompts for Suno and other generators.

## Core Features
- Automatic text segmentation (Intro / Verse / Chorus / Bridge / Outro / Hook / Meta-Pause)
- Dynamic vocal engine (timbre, range, techniques, multi-voice, gender mixing)
- Full instrument matrix with emotional and color binding
- Color-emotion hidden layer (energetic field of the song)
- Zero Pulse detection and structural silence handling
- Multi-engine symbiosis (emotion ↔ tone ↔ rhythm ↔ style ↔ color)
- User command interpreter (full parameter override: BPM, Key, Genre, Vocals, Instruments, Structure)
- Auto-annotation layer (breath, dynamics, vocal shifts, section headers, meta markers)

## User Parameters
The engine accepts partial or full user parameter sets. Even if the user provides only one parameter (for example, key or genre), the engine adapts all other engines to respect this constraint. When multiple parameters are provided (BPM + Key + Genre + Vocal Type + Instruments), the system builds a full style and annotation profile around them.

StudioCore Engine will continue to expand emotionally and structurally, adding new adaptive layers, extended style logic, multi-voice dynamic models and improved user override protocols.
